                    A business meeting is, at its core, a group of two or more persons for the purpose of discussing concepts, <br>
                    aims, and goals related to the workplace. Meetings for business purposes can be held in person atanoffice <br>
                    or in another place, over the telephone, or even by video conferencing. Meetings are held with staffmembers,<br>
                    directors, executives, customers, prospects, vendors, associates, and anybody else who has a connection tothe<br>
                    business. A meeting is typically required when a problem cannot be adequately conveyed over the phone or by <br>
                    email and necessitates physical engagement with one or more persons. A business meeting's main goal is frequently<br>
                    to make crucial decisions involving the company. A meeting makes it easier to communicate ideas, whether it's<br>
                    discussing how to increase the marketing budget for the department or how many employees to let go of during a <br>
                    transitional period. It's simpler to successfully convey crucial information to key stakeholders while interacting <br>
                    face-to-face in order to obtain the desired choice.
